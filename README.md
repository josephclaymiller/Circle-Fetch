Circle-Fetch
============

Game made in 4 hours for Coronablitz

You play a dog that is trying to collect tennis balls but constantly
runs in circles. You help the dog out by tapping to make the dog go
forward. I based the game on my own dog and the peculiar way he plays
fetch; circling and collecting tennis balls instead of bringing them
back.

The game is for mobile devices and was programed in Lua using the Corona SDK.
